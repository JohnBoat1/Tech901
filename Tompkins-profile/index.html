                    <p>I believe I have exceptional organization skills and have always longed to learn programming. I enjoy identifying and correcting errors. I am a perfectionist who has very high standards and is rarely satisifed with my work until it is at optimized as possible.</br>I wish to take this course so that I may prove my abilities and progress into a career involving programming. Hopefully something in the video game development field, however that is not a requirement. Thank you for considering me!</p>
